                Season 3, Episode 22, "The Parking Garage," features the famous foursome searching for their car in a parkade after Kramer forgets where he parked. During the half-hour, Jerry gets busted for public urination, Elaine's brand-new fish dies, and George misses his parent's anniversary celebration. The cast has since said that while they enjoy the finished episode it was one of the most physically exhausting to film, especially for Michael Richards who asked the prop department to put an actual air conditioner in the box for authenticity.

                In Season 3, Episode 19, "The Limo," George's car breaks down on his way to the airport to pick up Jerry. When Jerry mentions a passenger named O'Brien was refused boarding, George suggests he pretend to be O'Brien, so they can get a free ride back into the city. The pair soon discovers O'Brien is a neo-Nazi leader, and they are heading to Madison Square Garden to speak at a Rally. The case of mistaken identity gets funnier as the episode goes on. Kramer questions Jerry's real identity, George leans into fascism to impress a Nazi woman, and soon the pair is confronted wit mobs of angry protestors.

                The famous friends visit The Hamptons in Season 5, Episode 21. The episode is pure comic genius as George awkwardly deals with "shrinkage" after Jerry's girlfriend Rachel accidentally walks in on George in the nude. Things get even funnier when Jerry and George bring Elaine into the mix to assess how much women know about shrinkage, to which she exclaims "it shrinks!?"

                Season 2, Episode 11, "The Chinese Restaurant," was filmed in real-time as the cast waits for a table at a Chinese restaurant. When the idea was pitched, studio executives were horrified at the simplicity of the episode and almost prevented it from being aired. The Chinese Restaurant is now one of the most iconic episodes of Seinfeld due to the relatable social situations its cast encounters while waiting for a table.

The episode also features one of the most memorable quotes in its nine-season history: "But I dont wanna be a pirate!"

Julia Louis-Dreyfus steals the show with her hilarious drunk acting as both George and Jerry ply Elaine with peach schnapps to reveal the secrets of "the vault".

After the Rosses forget to serve the marble rye brought by the Costanzas, Frank steals it back when he leaves. Even the morally questionable George is horrified at the thought, and plans a romantic evening on Kramer's hansom cab for the Rosses to later sneak a new rye bread back in. When an elderly woman buys the last marble rye, Jerry must resort to a marble rye mugging to aid his friend. The episode is made even better by Kramer feeding his horse Rusty Beef-a-reeno moments before the ride and the horse gassing out the Ross's on their romantic escapade.

Elaine and George encounter a mannequin in a high-end retail store, that is a doppelganger of Elaine.
