                Seinfeld, a sitcom created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, ranked among the most popular television programs of the 1990s. 
                The series ran from 1989 to 1998 on NBC, with a total of nine seasons and 180 episodes. Often celebrated as "the show about nothing," Seinfeld enraptured audiences with its explorations of the minutiae of everyday life. 
                It depicted the lives of a fictionalized version of Seinfeld, his best friend, George Costanza (played by Jason Alexander), his ex-girlfriend, Elaine (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and his neighbor, Cosmo Kramer (played by Michael Richards).

                In 2013, the Writers Guild of America voted Seinfeld the <a class="link" href="https://www.wga.org/writers-room/101-best-lists/101-best-written-tv-series/list">second best-written TV series of all time</a> (behind The Sopranos).

                Seinfeld and David originally set out to create a 90-minute special to air in the Saturday Night Live timeslot. When they started to develop their concept of following how a comedian gets their stand-up material, they realized the premise would work better in a 30-minute sitcom format.
                The series' pilot reportedly performed poorly with test audiences. The episode elicited “<a class="link link__body" href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/seinfeld-from-flop-to-acclaimed-hit/">lukewarm reactions among adults and teens and very low reactions among kids</a>.”
                Members of the pilot test audience thought the main character (Seinfeld) was too wimpy, the show was too New York, and that nothing of substance happened.
